# PIG GAME

## RULES:

- The game has 2 players, playing in rounds
- In each turn, a player rolls a single die as many times as he whishes. The result each roll is added to his ROUND score
- BUT, if the player rolls a 1, his ROUND score is lost, and it is the next players turn.
- The player can choose to 'Hold', which means that his ROUND score gets added to his "Global" score. After that, it's the next player's turn
- The first player to reach 100 points in their "Global" score wins the game.
